When Tim Bernes-Lee descended the mountain in 1991 with two stone tablets inscribed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html">html</a> 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http">http</a> all things were well. After that, stuff started to go downhill. People began to bolt
on many new additions like css or took it in ill devised directions like xhtml. Css grew version numbers, browser vendors added their own spin on the
whole thing, some demented minds introduced dynamic web pages and finally Netscape took the last few pages from the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon">Necronomicon</a> and implemented them as JavaScript. The browser vendors followed them willingly on
their path into madness. Today, a <i>modern</i> browser is more complex than most operating systems, consumes memory like a black hole and contains 
about a dozen parsers and jit compilers. IHMO web browsers are probably turing complete and fullfill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">
Greenspun's tenth rule</a> and  Zawinski's law.<br />
Now, there are a few bits which actually improved on the god given standard. I see html as a way to link structured text together and present it in a pleasant way.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_font">Downloadable fonts</a> and the video/audio tags are among them.<br/>
So, here are my tips for building a user friendly website<br/>

<ul>
<li>Css is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper">Carolina Reaper</a>, best used in very small doses</li>
<li>Avoid JS as much as possible, it's the path to hell. Try to get by with static html tags.</li>
<li><b>No Flash</b> ever</li>
<li>Black text on a white background.</li>
<li>Make your pages less dynamic. Let scripts build your pages static.</li>
<li>Test your websites with lynx. If they don't look nice in lynx, you fucked up.</li>
<li>No autoplay for videos or sound. Come on, what is wrong with you?!</li>
</ul>
