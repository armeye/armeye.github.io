<h1>The good and the bad, or: software sucks</h1>

In the fine tradition of these <a href ="http://suckless.org/sucks">two</a> 
<a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software">sites</a>
, I present to you my own list of good and bad software. I agree with those lists most of the time, but I have a few
differnt things to add. There will be duplicates here; things that I <i>really</i> like or dislike.
Also I thought it would be fun to write my own list and be smug about it. Have fun! 

<h2>The good</h2>
People with a good track record of writing non sucky software. Their stuff is worth checking out. You will find 
enough software to build yourself a nice, working system.<br>

<h2>The not good enough</h2>
This is software i like but don't consider good enough to invest  more of my time into.<br>
<p><b>Haskell</b>. I really like functional programming. Haskell has some great features: Nonmutable data,
pattern matching and monads; to name a few. But it's either too complicated or i'm not smart enough. Haskell is
perfectly good for Vulcans or Time Lords but in the time it takes meto remember what the hell stuff like runST does
again, I can crank out a working program in C.<br>
<b>Alternative</b>: Rust is a better choice. Many of Haskell's nice features, many additional libs and less stress 
for my puny brain.</p>
<p>I like <b>Emacs</b>, I've been a heavy user for years. I even wrote my own minor modes and a good amout
of elisp. But recently, when I needed to do editing stuff, i found myself back at the console writing sed scripts or
piping stuff trough sort and grep more often.  I see no reason to memorize all the keyboard shortcuts when I can
accomplish the same things with all the well known UNIX tools. <br>
<b>Alternative a</b>: Acme, the default editor from Plan 9. Makes it easy to pipe your files to commands and back,
 has a sufficiently sed like editing language, and allows for things like running a shell or irc client in it's buffers.<br>
<b>Alternative b</b>: Mg, one of the 2 default editors that come with OpenBSD. Comes with standard emacs bindings and a dired
mode. 
</p>
<p><b>Vi</b> is good small editor. it has a command language und you can pipe buffers trough other programs.
But it uses it's own syntax instead of adopting and expanding something like sed. Also, I hate modal editing!<br>
<b>Alternative</b>: Sam, the predecessor to Acme. Sed like command language, multiple buffers and designed
to get the most out of the unix toolset</p>
<p>Languages in the LISP family are very nice and powerful, but <b>Common Lisp</b> and even many Scheme systems have 
grown very complex.<br><b>Alternative</b>: <a href="http://t3x.org/s9fes">Scheme 9 from Empty Space</a> is a small r4rs 
interpreter available under public domain.</p>
