    <center><h1>SJW culture considered harmful</h1></center>
	It's a race to the bottom with those people, you will always find someone who is more opressed or marginalized. In time this will make the whole movement collapse on itself. By now it has turned into a minefield. You can't be sure that there is someone who has a higher amount of SJW points who will start to unleash a shitstorm on you for ereasing them or whatever. Even the best of intentions can turn you into an enabler of rape culture or the patriarchy. You can't win. The only move is not to play.<br>
