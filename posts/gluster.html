    GlusterFs expected an undefined behavior of readdir cookies on ext4 filesystems and the shit finally hit the fan
    when the Linux devs decided to break that undefined behavior.
    
    <h2>What happend?</h2>
    Altough a readdir cookie for ext4 is 64 bits long it used to use only 32 bits. So the GlusterFs devs decided to went
    back to the 1990s and used the upper 32 bits to encode their own stuff into it. Everything was peachy until the ext4
    devs decided to finally use those upper bits.

    <h2>Oooops!</h2>
    Due to the fast turnaround cycle of the linux kernel this change got away under the radar and new kernel images were
    happily distributed while unknowingly breaking existing GlusterFs installations. By the time people started to notice
    that something was wrong, it was already too late; and the rest is, as we say, foobar.

    <h2>So, who's at fault here?</h2>
    Well, both sides, actually. The GlusterFs devs for relying on undefined kernel behaviour and not abstracting
    filesystem apis away and also the linux devs for breaking ABI and API whenever they want to. An average time of 6
    months between new kernel releases, of which everyone of them could break the ABI is just insane.

    <h2>What could have been done better?</h2>
    Linux should adopt a better release cycle which carefully tries to not break ABI on major releases like, for example
    FreeBSD. That would leave enough time to expose those rare bugs to write a patch before there are conflicting userspace
    procedures.
